## Description
**Cajeer Books Engine** (abbr. **CBE**) is an open source content management system (Open-source CMS), which was developed by the Russian studio "Cajeer 404" (formerly "Cajeer Web") specifically for the Russian studio "Cajeer Software" (formerly - "Cajeer Developers") and is used in many projects of the studio "Cajeer Software". The development was started in 2020, but from 2020 to 2021 the system was private, and starting from 2022 the system was completely rewritten by new authors and received the status of an open system, and therefore the 2022 version can rightfully be considered the third version of the system. The system is written in the PHP general-purpose scripting language and uses the MySQL relational database for data storage. The system provides an interface for working with the page database, differentiation of access rights to system administration, the ability to process text both in its own format and in HTML format, the ability to upload images and other files, and other features. The extension system allows users to add their own new features and programming interfaces. The main languages of the system are English, Spanish, Russian and French, there are also German and Italian localizations.
